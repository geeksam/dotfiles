# Fusion 360 has an unfortunate tendency to hang on launch.
# (And by "hang", I mean "please enjoy this Spinning Beach Ball of Death.")
#
# This "solution" comes directly from Autodesk:
# https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Fusion-360-hangs-freezes-on-startup-on-Mac-OS.html
#
# Seems excessive to me, but then, the same page lists as a possible cause
# "Pending Windows updates that are required to be installed"...
#
# ...which seems almost reasonable until one notices that this page is
# specifically about launch issues on MacOS.
#
# So, y'know, set appropriate expectations I guess?
